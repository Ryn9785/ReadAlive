        <p>Will the leader give her the key?</p>
        <p>Xie Wanying wasn't an arrogant little princess; she never assumed she could wield influence. So, when asked
            if Ren
            Chongda would give her the key to the anatomy room, she answered candidly, "It's impossible."</p>
        <p>Zhao Zhaowei and the others had anticipated her response. From their earlier conversation, they had sensed
            her
            careful and cautious demeanor, which set her apart from other girls her age.</p>
        <p>"Don't worry about it. If you happen to run into Ren Chongda, you can joke around with him. Despite his
            unassuming
            appearance, he's quite witty. Who knows, you might even get in his good books." Zhao Zhaowei suggested.</p>
        <p>What were the Three Musketeers?</p>
        <p>"The Three Musketeers refer to Ren Chongda, Zhu Huicang, and the most renowned heartthrob of our school, Cao
            Yong."
        </p>
        <p>At the mention of Cao Yong, Xie Wanying immediately conjured an image of the handsome young man who had been
            present
            in the emergency room at Auntie's Hospital that night. "They say Cao Yong is incredibly talented," Feng
            Yicong asked
            Zhao Zhaowei, seeking confirmation.</p>
        <p>"He's beyond amazing. He was already an academic prodigy in his university years, but the school sent him
            abroad for
            further studies. After returning, he directly ventured into brain surgery. Brain surgery, being a relatively
            nascent
            field in our domestic medical community, favors newcomers. Many even speculate that Cao Yong might become
            the future
            director of our hospital."</p>
        <p>Zhao Zhaowei's seemingly gossipy disclosure piqued the interest of those around him.</p>
        <p>A senior brother who could potentially become a dean in the future—flattery was inevitable.</p>
        <p>"How do you know Cao Yong?" Feng Yicong and the others inquired enthusiastically.</p>
        <p>"Ren Chongda and Cao Yong are good friends. They often dine at the alley connecting our college and the
            hospital. If
            you happen to bump into them, don't hesitate to say hi. Ren Chongda may seem laid-back, but he has a sharp
            wit. With
            luck, you might even leave a positive impression. It could facilitate your prospects of working in the
            affiliated
            hospital in the future—there should be no issue at all."</p>
        <p>As Xie Wanying and the others absorbed this information, they came to realize that staying in the affiliated
            hospital
            after graduation was no simple matter, even for students in the prestigious eighth-year class.</p>
        <p>The National Association stood as the highest medical institution in the country, and the National
            Association
            Hospital ranked among the top three general hospitals nationwide. It was hailed as the last refuge for
            patients in
            the medical field and the ultimate destination for the nation's most elite medical graduates.</p>
        <p>A classmate received a message from the class monitor on their mobile phone and announced to the others, "The
            monitor
            said he's handling the distribution of the military training uniforms and needs to stand in line. He won't
            be able
            to return soon. Everyone should head back to the dormitory, and he'll bring the uniforms to our dorm this
            afternoon
            or evening."</p>
        <p>The monitor seemed to be quite considerate, eliciting a chorus of gratitude from the students.</p>
        <p>Seeing the phone, Xie Wanying recalled she needed to call her mother. She turned to Zhao Zhaowei and asked,
            "Where's
            the cheapest place to make a call?"</p>
        <p>"You didn't know when you arrived, so let me fill you in. First, get yourself a prepaid SIM card. It's
            cheaper to buy
            from a street vendor than at a supermarket. Then, at night, head to the hospital to find the payphone with
            the IC
            phone card machine. The hospital outpatient clinic is empty at night, so you'll have an easier time getting
            access
            compared to the phone booths outside."</p>
        <p>"Thank you."</p>
        <p>Afterward, Xie Wanying returned to the dormitory with her classmates. She looked at the two unoccupied beds
            in the
            room and pondered for a moment before the realization dawned on her.</p>
        <p>She shared the dormitory with two senior sisters. But both of them were out on clinical rotations and
            wouldn't be
            back at the dormitory anytime soon.</p>
        <p>Brushing her fingers against the mosquito nets hung by her senior sisters, she noticed a layer of dust had
            collected—a testament to the demanding schedules of medical students during their clinical rotations.</p>
        <p>Without roommates to accompany her for meals, Xie Wanying returned to the dormitory after lunch, took a nap
            in the
            afternoon, and planned to visit the affiliated hospital in the evening to call home.</p>
