        <br>
        <p>Around six or seven o'clock in the evening, Xie Wanying located the alleyway connecting the school to the
            affiliated
            hospital.</p>
        <p>This spot remained relatively concealed, known only to insiders from the hospital and school. Without Zhao
            Zhaowei's
            guidance, she would have remained oblivious to this secret location.</p>
        <p>Upon arriving, she noticed restaurants lining both sides of the street. As dinner time approached, especially
            in the
            evening, the fragrance of cooking wafted through the air. Establishments close to schools and hospitals
            thrived due
            to their prime locations, ensuring a steady stream of customers.</p>
        <p>Many patrons dining here were medical staff from the hospital, as well as teachers and students from the
            school.
            Consequently, greetings were exchanged all around— "Hey, Lao Liu!" or "Teacher Zhang!" echoed through the
            air.</p>
        <p>After her meal, Xie Wanying began her quest for shops selling IC cards along the street. Following Zhao
            Zhaowei's
            advice, she searched diligently, hoping to find a shop offering a 50% discount card. The allure of a 50%
            discount on
            phone cards was too tempting. Xie Wanying scoured through different options.</p>
        <p>Eventually, she discovered a shop offering a 30% discount. She stood by the entrance, waiting for the
            shopkeeper to
            attend to her. In the background, a group of students from her school engaged in a conversation.</p>
        <p>"Hey, have you heard? They say this year's eighth-year class has a female prodigy."</p>
        <p>"I heard she's quite pretty."</p>
        <p>A female student, beautiful. Undoubtedly, the latter detail garnered more attention. Medical schools weren't
            known
            for having as many handsome guys and beauties as film and television colleges, but academic excellence was
            widespread.</p>
        <p>"Could she be our school's future belle?"</p>
        <p>"Possibly."</p>
        <p>"I wonder what Zhang Xiaohua thinks."</p>
        <p>Unmoved, Xie Wanying didn't turn around. This rebirth was surprising for her in many ways, especially the
            newfound
            attention she was receiving for her appearance. She had always considered herself to have an unremarkable
            appearance.</p>
        <p>She aspired to be a technical doctor, yet suddenly people were talking about her looks. This unexpected focus
            on her
            appearance left her feeling somewhat troubled.</p>
        <p>"Zhang Xiaohua is indeed very beautiful. Word has it that the school's publicity office wanted her to take a
            picture
            to promote admissions to freshmen."</p>
        <p>"When did our school need to advertise for admissions?"</p>
        <p>"Is Zhang Xiaohua around?"</p>
        <p>"Have you not seen the campus beauties during your freshman year? Zhang Xiaohua belongs to our school's art
            troupe
            and radio station. She often comes here for dinner at night. You're not the only freshman who's come here
            hoping to
            catch a glimpse of our campus beauties."</p>
        <p>"Where?"</p>
        <p>"There, at the hot pot restaurant."</p>
        <p>Someone pointed to the second-floor hot pot restaurant above. Students downstairs craned their necks,
            searching for
            the campus belle like curious monkeys. A window revealed a silhouette of a beautiful woman with long hair,
            her image
            reminiscent of the protagonist in a Rejoice shampoo advertisement. She wore a princess-like pink butterfly
            headband.
        </p>
        <p>Feeling the attention below, Zhang Xiaohua turned her head and suddenly noticed something. She stood up,
            exclaiming
            enthusiastically, "Senior brother!"</p>
        <p>Naturally, everyone's gaze shifted to see who had caught the campus belle's attention.</p>
        <p>After scanning the scene for a while, no one seemed to fit the description of the person she was searching
            for.</p>
        <p>The person accompanying Zhang Xiaohua gave her a playful smile and said, "Could you have mistaken someone
            else for
            him?"</p>
        <p>"I suppose so. For a moment, I thought I saw Senior Brother Cao and the others." Zhang Xiaohua stuck out her
            tongue
            and sat back down.</p>
        <p>The freshmen were charmed by this sight. Their campus belle was not just beautiful; she was also adorable.
        </p>
        <p>Having obtained her 30% discount card, Xie Wanying breathed a sigh of relief. She turned and descended the
            steps.
            Observing her walking away, someone among the crowd was taken aback, "This girl is also very pretty. I
            wonder which
            department she's from at our school."</p>
