        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>In 1996, Xie Wanying, the eldest daughter of the Xie family, boldly declared her ambition to become a
            surgeon.
            However, her proclamation was met with a mixture of amusement and skepticism from those around her.</p>

        <p>"People say a phoenix gives birth to a phoenix, and a dog gives birth to a dog. A truck driver's daughter
            aiming
            to be a doctor? That's as likely as pigs learning to climb trees," they quipped.</p>

        <p>Unfazed by the doubts, Xie Wanying responded, "I'm not merely going to be a doctor—I'm going to be a
            cardiothoracic
            surgeon."</p>

        <p>Her statement created ripples of disbelief in the medical community. Even a relative who was a doctor
            ridiculed
            her, asking, "Do you understand how high the admission standards for medical school are? Can you even make
            the cut?"</p>

        <p>He continued, "There isn't a single female cardiothoracic surgeon in the entire country. Even the most
            accomplished
            female doctors haven't reached that pinnacle. Who do you think you are?"</p>

        <p>A chorus of skeptics chimed in: "You might just end up in a third-rate medical school, working as a basic
            county-level
            medical staffer. Who on earth will want to marry you?"</p>

        <p>However, Xie Wanying remained resolute. At the conclusion of her college entrance exams, she secured a
            coveted
            spot in the nation's top surgery program, earning the province's highest science award. She embarked on
            her journey at a prestigious capital hospital and swiftly caught the attention of various surgical
            department
            heads, even during her internship.</p>

        <p>"Student Xie Wanying, you'd be a fantastic addition to our general surgery department."</p>

        <p>"No, our urology department is a better fit for you—"</p>

        <p>"We're in need of female doctors in pediatric surgery, much like Xie Wanying."</p>

        <p>Meanwhile, her relatives' social media posts fell into an awkward silence.</p>

        <p>In due course, Xie Wanying independently accomplished the youngest Tetralogy of Fallot surgery in the nation,
            represented
            the domestic cardiothoracic surgery association at international medical forums, and published the world's
            pioneering minimally invasive heart valve repair operation. Through these achievements, she solidified her
            standing as a distinguished female surgeon in the field.</p>
