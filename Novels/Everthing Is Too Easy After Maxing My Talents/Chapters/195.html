        <br>
        <p>Clearly, as a young man, MO Fei was still inexperienced when compared to a seasoned operator like Han Longfei. He believed that with the support of the other members of the Resistance base, he could influence and alter Han Longfei's orders. However, Han Longfei, who had managed to become the City Lord of N City right under the noses of the Cloud Sky Group while leading the Resistance Army, was a formidable figure. There was no way he could be easily manipulated without his knowledge. Han Longfei had a few tricks up his sleeve.</p>
<p>Han Longfei had sent Li Yueming to the logistics department and arranged for him to become a captain not only to comfort Li Yueming but also to test the loyalty of the Resistance's officers. Han Longyan had found an excuse to dispatch Li Yueming and deliver a message, giving MO Fei the impression that he was being promoted to captain of the seventh brigade.</p>
<p>MO Fei's ambition was transparent, but due to Han Longfei's unique status, he couldn't monitor the movements of the Resistance Army in real-time. That's why he had sent MO Fei with the latest orders.</p>
<p>Han Longfei was well aware of Li Yueming's capabilities and had a clear understanding of the situation. He knew that Li Yueming was the right person for the job. That's why he handed the sword to Li Yueming.</p>
<p>MO Fei remained oblivious to these intricacies and was still unaware of the gravity of the situation. He was confident that the leader's favor would allow him to rise in the ranks and didn't see the trap being set for him.</p>
<p>With all these pieces in place, MO Fei hadn't connected the dots yet, making him an easy target.</p>
<p>Li Yueming didn't hold back, and as MO Fei looked on in shock, he retrieved an abandoned iron sword from the ground. MO Fei, now in full panic, asked what Li Yueming was trying to do in a Resistance camp.</p>
<p>Li Yueming responded with a smile as a golden light enveloped the sword, indicating his improved mastery of the Wilderness Martial Saint's talent. This proficiency allowed him to apply less force and achieve a higher level of weapon synchronization. Facing a relatively weak opponent like MO Fei, who had just reached the C+ energy level, it required minimal effort.</p>
<p>With a casual swing, Li Yueming caused the abandoned sword to turn into a streak of light, disappearing instantly. MO Fei, who was already alarmed, unleashed his talent, attempting to envelop the golden sword with the earth. His unique power was a source of pride and fame, allowing him to control a portion of the earth's energy. His talent was rated as an S grade, but in front of Li Yueming, it was rendered powerless. The golden sword overcame MO Fei's defenses, rendering his power ineffective.</p>
<p>The golden blade light moved with astonishing speed and cut through MO Fei's throat in an instant. MO Fei clutched his throat, his face showing disbelief, trying to speak but only managing weak whimpers due to the injury.</p>
<p>Within seconds, blood gushed from the wound, splattering the ground. Despite his feelings of unwillingness and regret, MO Fei fell to the ground before he could understand what had gone wrong. He was a C+ class supernatural being, and according to the records, Li Yueming was just sixteen years old. How could a sixteen-year-old possess such terrifying strength, and what made him dare to commit such a public act?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, MO Fei wouldn't live long enough to find answers to these questions. As he lay dying, his expression remained a mixture of confusion, regret, and fear.</p>
<p>Watching the entire scene, Scarface, MO Fei's nephew, was left utterly dumbfounded. He stared at his fallen nephew, who was bleeding from the neck, unable to comprehend the situation.</p>
