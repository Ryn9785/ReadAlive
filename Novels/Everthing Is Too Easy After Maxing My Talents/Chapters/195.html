        <br>
        <p>"So your boss arranged for you two to drive? Aren't you afraid of being robbed?" Li Yueming asked.</p>

        <p>Gao Tian burst into laughter. "To be honest, before we left, Boss told us that you were his bodyguard. He
            told us to
            drive as much as we wanted. As long as we're not heading to the headquarters of the Cloud Sky Corporation,
            we can go
            anywhere!"</p>

        <p>Upon hearing this, Li Yueming was at a loss for words, but he realized that their limited knowledge of their
            whereabouts was a benefit.</p>

        <p>As the pickup truck continued its journey, Gao Ji, who was behind the wheel, glanced at the rearview mirror
            and
            casually mentioned, "I've heard a bit about the ancient martial arts practitioners you mentioned earlier."
        </p>

        <p>Li Yueming's interest was piqued, and he focused on Gao Ji.</p>

        <p>Gao Ji continued, "Legend has it that over 300 years ago, ancient warriors emerged. They were a rare breed,
            each
            possessing an invincible body impervious to firearms and enigmatic abilities that defied scientific
            understanding."
        </p>

        <p>Gao Ji elaborated that the Andrei Science and Technology Group, which initially started as a regular
            technology
            company, began to explore the possibilities of enhancing the human body's capabilities after observing these
            ancient
            warriors. He added that the appearance of the ancient warriors had played a crucial role in inspiring the
            development of the Extraordinary Potion.</p>

        <p>More than 300 years had passed, and ancient martial arts practitioners had vanished, giving way to the era of
            science
            and technology corporations. Gao Ji emphasized that these stories were anecdotal, originating from tales
            told by the
            Resistance camp's elders, and should be taken with a grain of skepticism. However, he mentioned that if Li
            Yueming
            indeed possessed the extraordinary talent of the Wilderness Martial God, he might have a connection to the
            ancient
            martial arts practitioners.</p>

        <p>As the two conversed, the military green pickup truck continued its journey through the desolate desert road.
        </p>

        <p>Li Yueming was lost in thought. The revelation that the development of the Extraordinary Potion was inspired
            by
            ancient warriors intrigued him, suggesting that there might be more to the story than the public history he
            knew.
        </p>

        <p>Gao Ji's information added a layer of complexity to his understanding of this world.</p>

        <p>As the conversation flowed, dozens of scavengers on makeshift motorcycles appeared, shadowing the military
            truck.
            They were inspecting the cargo and security of the vehicle. In response, Li Yueming demonstrated his martial
            strength by transforming into a massive golden sword, which sent the scavengers on motorcycles tumbling. The
            remaining scavengers decided not to challenge them.</p>

        <p>The journey continued, and after nine days, they reached a small town as described by Gao Ji. Li Yueming and
            Sun Ruo
            bade farewell to the two brothers, who still had a mission to deliver supplies to the northernmost
            battlefield.</p>

        <p>Once the pickup truck was out of sight, Li Yueming and Sun Ruo entered a seemingly inconspicuous tavern. The
            bar was
            empty, and a middle-aged woman was napping at the counter. She woke up at the sound of their arrival and
            gestured
            for them to come inside.</p>

        <p>In a small courtyard behind the bar, three men were playing poker, and one of them complained about the delay
            in the
            arrival of a "guest." Another man in his thirties reprimanded the younger one, emphasizing the importance of
            the
            mission assigned by their leader.</p>
