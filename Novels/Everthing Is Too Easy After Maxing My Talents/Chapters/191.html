        <p>On the left, a young man in his mid-twenties couldn't help but complain, "I can't stand it! Captain, I think
            we
            shouldn't have brought MO Fei here, right? This kid relies on his extraordinary powers and is nothing but
            trouble!"
            The three of them continued to chat while playing cards.</p>

        <p>The middle-aged woman coughed softly, drawing the attention of the three men to the commotion.</p>

        <p>The man in his thirties, who had been playing cards, discarded his hand and stood up. He asked, "Are the two
            of you
            the 'guests?"</p>

        <p>Li Yueming nodded and took out the medal given to him by Han Longfei. He introduced himself, saying, "My name
            is Li
            Yueming. May I know your names?"</p>

        <p>Upon seeing the medal, the man sighed with relief, stood up, and introduced himself as the leader of N City's
            Resistance Army's Third Team, Han Longyan. He pointed to the two others, mentioning the vice-leader, Qian
            Jun, and
            the elite member, MO Fei.</p>

        <p>Han Longyan bore a resemblance to Han Longtian, and it was evident they were relatives. This connection
            helped
            maintain control over the Resistance from afar.</p>

        <p>After some pleasantries, Han Longyan welcomed Li Yueming and Sun Ruo to the N City's Resistance Army and
            extended an
            invitation to join them at their headquarters at East Peak Mountain. Li Yueming and Sun Ruo accepted the
            invitation.
        </p>

        <p>However, one of the team members, MO Fei, was more interested in Sun Ruo. He tried to impress her with
            flattery, but
            she dismissed his advances, making it clear she wasn't interested. MO Fei then proudly declared his status
            as a C+
            class supernatural being and boasted of his achievements within the Resistance.</p>

        <p>Li Yueming, showing his usual calm demeanor, decided to choose a more reserved position within the
            Resistance. He
            mentioned that he would prefer a logistics role, as he was inexperienced and didn't excel in combat. Han
            Longyan
            agreed and said they could make a formal decision after receiving approval from the leader, Han Longfei.</p>

        <p>MO Fei, who had been eavesdropping outside the door, was pleased with Li Yueming's choice and chimed in with
            support
            for the logistics position. Han Longyan scolded MO Fei for butting in, but it was clear his words held no
            real
            anger.</p>

        <p>After considering the situation, Han Longyan agreed to arrange a logistics position for Li Yueming. He
            explained that
            they would finalize the specifics after receiving confirmation from Han Longfei.</p>

        <p>Li Yueming accepted the offer with a smile and suggested he could work on repairing mechanical equipment
            since he had
            some prior knowledge in that area.</p>
