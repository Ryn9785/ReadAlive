        <br>

        <p>Hearing this.</p>

        <p>Li Yueming finally came back to his senses. He raised his eyes and said, “You can ask me about anything of
            course!”</p>

        <p>Han Longfei did not stand on ceremony and asked directly, “I have to confirm two things. First, how old are
            you now?
        </p>

        <p>When he asked this question, Han Longfei felt a little nervous for some reason.</p>

        <p>Talking about this topic.</p>

        <p>Li Yueming touched his nose and said, “Although it sounds unbelievable, I’m not even seven years old yet!”
        </p>

        <p>I’m still not seven years old So, he was six years old?</p>

        <p>Han Longfei sized up Li Yueming.</p>

        <p>The current Li Yueming had a slender figure and was nearly 1.7 meters tall. He was basically no different
            from an
            adult.</p>

        <p>Damn it.</p>

        <p>Genetic mutation at the age of six?</p>

        <p>Although Han Longfei was already mentally prepared, when he heard Li Yueming’s confirmation, he still felt a
            little
            speechless.</p>

        <p>He thought about it.</p>

        <p>Han Longfei tried his best to organize his words and said, “That’s why it’s convenient for me to know that
            you’re in
            Yunxiao Group’s laboratory… What kind of experiment is it?”</p>

        <p>Hearing his question.</p>

        <p>Li Yueming instantly understood why Han Longfei asked these two questions.</p>

        <p>Everyone knew.</p>

        <p>All these years, the Yunxiao Group had been doing genetic research.</p>

        <p>And Li Yueming was the experimental subject that escaped at this time.</p>

        <p>In order to capture him.</p>

        <p>The Cloud Sky Corporation had almost turned the entire N City upside down.</p>

        <p>Therefore, Han Longfei asked so many questions to confirm if Li Yueming was one of the unstable factors in
            Yunxiao
            Group’s laboratory that had undergone genetic modification.</p>

        <p>Regarding this.</p>

        <p>Li Yueming did not answer directly.</p>

        <p>Instead, he threw back another question, “Would you believe me if I said that I escaped before the experiment
            officially started?”</p>

        <p>Han Longfei sized him up.</p>

        <p>He hesitated for a moment before shaking his head.</p>

        <p>Nonsense, he was not stupid.</p>

        <p>How could a normal person be six years old and 1.7 meters tall?</p>

        <p>Seeing this, Li Yueming couldn’t help but laugh, “Isn’t that enough? Don’t know too much. It’s not good to
            know too
            much. Just know that I won’t lose control!”</p>

        <p>In the middle of the battlefield.</p>

        <p>The City Defense Army took out all the large-caliber weapons they could muster.</p>

        <p>They bombarded the underground arena.</p>

        <p>Half an hour later, Professor Cheng, who had ‘resurrected’ from the dead, arrived with more people from the
            Cloud Sky
            Group headquarters.</p>

        <p>The underground arena had been physically leveled.</p>

        <p>That was not right.</p>

        <p>It was not accurate to describe it as razed to the ground.</p>

        <p>To be precise, a deep pit of more than ten meters was blasted into the entire underground arena.</p>

        <p>Almost all the buildings were turned into powder by the high temperature and explosion.</p>

        <p>He looked at the countless pieces of rotten meat around him, as well as the white flames that were still
            burning on
            the ground.</p>

        <p>Professor Cheng’s face was so dark that it was almost dripping with water.</p>

        <p>“What’s going on?” Where are the Experimentals?”</p>

        <p>Hearing this.</p>

        <p>A captain of the City Defense Army walked up and bowed proudly. “Sir, the Experimentals have been killed!
            We’ve used
            the heavy Phosphorescence Bullets and Laser Impact Bullets to clear the entire arena. I guarantee that not
            even an
            ant will be able to come out alive!!”</p>

        <p>Professor Cheng’s face twitched.</p>

        <p>After taking a few deep breaths, he said with a cold expression, “When did your City Defense Army become so
            capable?”
        </p>

        <p>Hearing this.</p>

        <p>The captain of the City Defense Army seemed to be even more proud. He straightened his body and said, “Sir,
            heavy
            firepower is the forte of the City Defense Army of N City!”</p>

        <p>Professor Cheng stared at the captain for a long time.</p>

        <p>He didn’t see any problems.</p>

        <p>A moment later, he suddenly asked, “Where’s your City Lord? There should be a transfer order to gather so
            many City
            Defense Army soldiers, right?”</p>

        <p>But before he could denounce him, Han Tianlong squeezed out from the crowd.</p>

        <p>“Professor, I’ve already told them that the City Defense Army will follow your orders!”</p>

        <p>Professor Cheng recalled the previous orders.</p>

        <p>In a moment of desperation, he seemed to have said that he would mobilize all his strength, regardless of
            life or
            death.</p>

        <p>He almost couldn’t catch his breath.</p>

        <p>Professor Cheng glanced at the City Defense Army and said nothing more.</p>

        <p>After all, he did have the intention to kill Li Yueming just now.</p>

        <p>Li Yueming had just become a supernatural being, but the ability he displayed was already beyond his
            imagination.</p>

        <p>Under such circumstances, indecisiveness would only lead to irreparable consequences.</p>

        <p>Therefore, even though his heart was bleeding.</p>

        <p>Professor Cheng tried his best to remain expressionless as he spoke to the Cloud Sky City soldiers behind
            him, “Get
            me the equipment. If you can’t find 0731’s body fragments, pull all of them back to be my test subjects!”
        </p>

        <p>He received the order.</p>

        <p>More than ten soldiers holding genetic testing machines walked out.</p>

        <p>They began to search the surroundings.</p>

        <p>A few minutes later.</p>

        <p>The soldiers found a few pieces of minced meat and a lot of blood.</p>

        <p>He returned to Professor Cheng’s side and said, “Report, after a genetic comparison, it has been confirmed
            that these
            are the remains of Experimental 0731!”</p>

        <p>He looked at the fragmented body parts in front of him.</p>

        <p>Even though his heart was still bleeding.</p>

        <p>However, Professor Cheng’s gloomy expression finally eased up a lot.</p>

        <p>Without a doubt, Li Yueming’s death was a huge loss for him.</p>

        <p>After all, a living Li Yueming was equivalent to an inexhaustible gene treasury.</p>

        <p>It would be of great help to his various experiments.</p>

        <p>But now, Li Yueming had awakened his extraordinary talent and become an extraordinary person. Moreover, he
            had just
            awakened and had already revealed a terrifying combat power.</p>

        <p>In this situation where the Experimentals were about to lose control.</p>

        <p>It was better to kill him on the spot than to let him escape and cause a backlash.</p>

        <p>Now that he could obtain some broken flesh and blood, he could be considered to have made up for some of his
            losses.
        </p>

        <p>However, for some reason.</p>

        <p>Professor Cheng felt that the whole process was a little strange.</p>

        <p>However, he couldn’t pinpoint what exactly went wrong.</p>
