        <p>Mika was taken aback, and he retreated several meters.</p>
<p>"You're the kid Long Fei sent over?" he asked.</p>
<p>The Resistance camp was neither too large nor too small. When Li Yueming first entered the camp, Mika had observed him multiple times. After all, Han Longfei had sent some soldiers to the rebel camp in the past, but no one had ever been appointed as a captain immediately upon arrival. It raised suspicions.</p>
<p>Moreover, he had heard that Li Yueming was just a teenager, so Mika paid special attention. However, his observations revealed that Li Yueming was an honest man who didn't express any dissatisfaction, even though his position as captain had been taken away. He clocked in and out of work on time every day in the logistics department, showing no arrogance or impudence.</p>
<p>After a few more observations, Mika felt at ease, thinking that Li Yueming was just a test sent by Han Longfei. But now, it was clear that this was more than a mere chess piece. This was a powerful force that could change the game's direction. Wasn't Han Longfei worried about the potential consequences of introducing such a formidable figure into the Resistance camp? However, Mika's concerns were no longer relevant; his primary concern was how to survive.</p>
<p>Mika dodged Li Yueming's attack, and he was impressed by Li Yueming's incredible speed and strength. As a B+ grade supernatural being, Li Yueming was quite formidable among others of the same grade. Mika knew he was in trouble. However, Li Yueming's attack had been so swift and powerful that Mika was worried he might not have been quick enough to avoid it. In a split second, the long saber could have cut him in half.</p>
<p>Mika realized that Li Yueming was not the insignificant pawn he had initially thought but a formidable force that could alter the game's course.</p>
<p>As Milan dodged the attack, Li Yueming wasted no time. He took a step forward and swung his long saber diagonally, making Milan feel a life-threatening crisis. Milan responded by invoking "Hellfire," sending a blazing flame toward Li Yueming.</p>
<p>Li Yueming narrowed his eyes, stepped back, and flicked his golden martial arts power on his iron blade. The orange flames and pale golden flames clashed, with the latter dominating the battle. Milan attempted to counter with a thick fire dragon, but Li Yueming's pale golden flames proved to be ferocious.</p>
<p>Milan's plan was to create a commotion and attract loyal soldiers to his aid. However, as he tried to flee the room, more than a hundred golden iron pillars shot out, turning him into a porcupine.</p>
<p>Not far away, Sun Ruo gave a thumbs up and exclaimed, "I hit ninety-two needles! I'm truly the best!"</p>
<p>Li Yueming extinguished the flames in his hand and looked at Milan. "Didn't I tell you not to lose your head?"</p>
<p>Sun Ruo, a B-class supernatural being, had only recently awakened. On paper, Milan, a B+ class supernatural being, should have been a challenging opponent for her. However, Li Yueming's enchantment of the iron pillars she controlled had been astonishingly effective.</p>
<p>After the dust had settled, the reality was terrifying. Despite being a B+ class supernatural being, Milan had been effortlessly defeated. Sun Ruo couldn't help but be amazed at Li Yueming's prowess.</p>
<p>Li Yueming paid no attention to her astonishment. Since Milan's body was now severely mutilated, beheading him to display his power was no longer an option. He had to find another way to send a message.</p>
<p>About half an hour later, all the remaining higher-ups in the Resistance camp received a message from the deputy leader, Milan, to gather in the camp's center for a meeting.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the news, the higher-ups began whispering among themselves. It was clear that news of Li Yueming's actions, including the deaths of MO Fei and Han Longyan, had already spread.</p>
<p>Several months earlier, when Li Yueming had first arrived, the upper echelons of the Resistance had sensed the tension between Han Tianlong and Milan. They had briefly considered Li Yueming as a potential ally, hoping that he might assist them in their power struggle. However, Li Yueming had appeared to be more compliant than they had anticipated. He willingly relinquished his position as the captain of the 7th brigade and accepted an assignment in the logistics department.</p>
<p>As time passed, Li Yueming faded into the background, and not many people paid attention to him. Little did they expect that he would soon stir up a significant disturbance. He not only killed MO Fei but also dared to eliminate Han Longyan, leaving all the management deeply concerned.</p>
<p>Thus, when they received the order from the deputy leader, Milan, the higher-ups rushed to the gathering point to see what decision would be made. To their surprise, the first person they encountered was not the deputy leader but a young man with a confident smile.</p>
<p>Initially, most of the higher-ups were bewildered because everything had happened so suddenly. But as they met Li Yueming's gaze and felt the coldness in the air, they realized that the situation had drastically changed.</p>
<p>Li Yueming surveyed the higher-ups of the Resistance camp and declared, "From now on, I will be the deputy leader of the Resistance Army camp in N City. Who agrees with this proposal?"</p>
