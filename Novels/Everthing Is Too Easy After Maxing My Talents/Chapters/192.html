        <br>
        <p>As expected, Li Yueming was assigned to the Rebellion Army's logistics department.</p>

        <p>It was clear from Han Longyan's reaction that Han Longfei, the leader, didn't have much control over the
            base.
            However, upon closer consideration, this wasn't surprising. Han Longfei's official identity was the mayor of
            N City,
            so as the leader of the resistance base, he couldn't have extensive contact with it. Over time, his
            influence on the
            base was likely to diminish. This was likely why Han Longfei had initially ordered Li Yueming to form a
            brigade, but
            now Han Longyan was suppressing this information.</p>

        <p>Of course, all of this was of no concern to Li Yueming. As long as he had a stable place to develop, that was
            sufficient, and everything else could be set aside for the time being.</p>

        <p>About two days later, Li Yueming was transferred to the logistics department of the rebel base. His primary
            responsibility was to repair the equipment of the soldiers who went out to collect supplies. Most of the
            military
            supplies in the rebel base were smuggled in from the N City factory by Han Longfei. The rebel base did have
            its own
            weapon processing plant, but it was quite old and produced lower-quality, non-high-tech weapons, essentially
            a small
            workshop. Li Yueming spent most of his time repairing equipment and weapons.</p>

        <p>While weapons were transported to the camp, food was not. Han Longfei lacked the power to discreetly
            transport
            supplies for tens of thousands of people into the mountains. As a result, the rebel camp needed to obtain
            daily
            living materials through hunting, farming, small-scale purchases, and other means.</p>

        <p>The North of East Peak Mountain bordered the southern part of the East Peak Empire, while the south connected
            to the
            northernmost part of the Red Leaf Empire. The lush forest extended for thousands of miles, providing
            abundant
            resources for food.</p>

        <p>However, it was important to note that due to nuclear radiation, the wild animals had become increasingly
            ferocious
            and violent. Some of them had even awakened extraordinary powers, making hunting in the jungle a challenging
            task.
        </p>

        <p>Six battalions, each consisting of 1,500 to 2,000 men, were responsible for this duty. These battalions were
            well-equipped and formed the core combat strength of the rebel forces. They rotated hunting and collecting
            food,
            with two to three teams going out each month while the others remained to safeguard the base. This rotation
            system
            was just enough to meet the base's daily needs.</p>

        <p>As Li Yueming entered the logistics and maintenance department, he found over 30 men repairing damaged
            mechanical
            arms. One of them, a man with a scar on his face, had a cigarette in his mouth and asked, "You must be new
            here?"
        </p>

        <p>Li Yueming furrowed his brows and looked at Scarface, nodding in confirmation.</p>

        <p>Scarface took a drag from his cigarette and blew the smoke towards Li Yueming. He said with disdain, "Kid,
            you look
            pretty young. You plan to compete with Mo Fei for the position of captain?"</p>

        <p>He continued, "What did you do to the leader? Or are you the leader's illegitimate son?"</p>

        <p>Li Yueming sneered and suddenly grabbed Scarface's neck, lifting him off the ground like a small chicken. He
            asked,
            "Who do you think you are?"</p>

        <p>Scarface struggled, but his physical strength was no match for Li Yueming. He couldn't even make Li Yueming's
            arm
            tremble.</p>

        <p>Seeing Scarface gasping for air, the surrounding logistics team members became alarmed. One of them advised,
            "Little
            brother, he's Mo Fei's uncle and the head of our logistics department. Teaching him a lesson is one thing,
            but it'll
            be trouble if he's killed."</p>

        <p>Clearly, Scarface, who was both arrogant and tyrannical, wasn't well-liked in the logistics department. Even
            though
            he had almost been strangled to death by Li Yueming, no one came to his aid.</p>

        <p>After some persuasion, Li Yueming relented, releasing Scarface and tossing him to the ground. He then stepped
            on
            Scarface's chest and said condescendingly, "I'll give you a chance. Inform everyone above you that the
            logistics
            department is now under my control. If you have any objections, feel free to come to me."</p>

        <p>Scarface coughed and gradually regained his composure. He glared at Li Yueming, and even though he wanted to
            say
            something harsh, he was taken aback by Li Yueming's deep, intense gaze and the chilling aura he exuded.
            Scarface
            didn't utter a word and instead got up and staggered away.</p>

        <p>The other men in the logistics team, who had stopped working, gathered around Li Yueming. They examined him
            and
            commented, "You're the new logistics department head appointed by the leader, right? As expected, young
            people these
            days can't be judged by their appearance."</p>
