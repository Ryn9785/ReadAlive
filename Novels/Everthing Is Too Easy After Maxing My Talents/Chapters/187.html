        <br>
        <p>He no longer continued to tangle with the monster and flew up nearly a hundred meters from the ground.</p>

        <p>In the next second.</p>

        <p>Tens of thousands of extremely destructive giant laser cannons hit the monster.</p>

        <p>He was beaten until he roared endlessly.</p>

        <p>All kinds of broken pieces of meat and organs exploded everywhere, and the only thing that targeted Li
            Yueming was
            some irrelevant firearms.</p>

        <p>What was going on?</p>

        <p>Shouldn’t the City Defense Army be on the same side as the Cloud Sky Group?</p>

        <p>Why was he attacking Professor Cheng’s experimental body now?</p>

        <p>A traitor of the new era?</p>

        <p>A barrage of heavy weapons rained down, razing the underground arena to the ground.</p>

        <p>Smoke and dust mixed with the smell of gunpowder rose into the air, and the entire western part of the city
            shook.
        </p>

        <p>Countless people rushed to the streets, causing chaos.</p>

        <p>Just as Li Yueming was puzzled.</p>

        <p>Suddenly, a figure flew over from the ground.</p>

        <p>“Sir, our boss wants to talk to you!” he said in a low voice as he walked to Li Yueming.</p>

        <p>Although the other party had changed his attire.</p>

        <p>However, Li Yueming still recognized the other party’s identity.</p>

        <p>This should be the director of the underground boxing arena who had given him the supernatural potion.</p>

        <p>Look at this curator.</p>

        <p>Then, he looked at the City Defense Army that was still firing on the ground.</p>

        <p>Li Yueming suddenly had some guesses in his heart. He nodded and said, “Where is your boss? Lead the way!”
        </p>

        <p>Ten minutes later.</p>

        <p>Under the director’s lead, Li Yueming came to an inconspicuous small courtyard.</p>

        <p>At this moment.</p>

        <p>The middle-aged man had already taken off his mask and other disguises.</p>

        <p>A beautiful and bald head was revealed.</p>

        <p>The face below was none other than the City Lord of N City, Han Longfei, who was despised by Professor Cheng
            at the
            airport.</p>

        <p>“How should I address you?” Han Longfei asked with a smile. It shouldn’t be 0731!</p>

        <p>“Just call me Li Yueming. Just tell me what you want to talk about!” Li Yueming said casually.</p>

        <p>“Hehehe, don’t be nervous. As the saying goes, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. I have no ill intentions
            towards
            you!” Han Longfei waved his hand.</p>

        <p>Behind him, the director silently retreated.</p>

        <p>When there were only two people left in the small courtyard.</p>

        <p>Han Longfei went straight to the point. “My name is Han Longfei. I’m the chief of the Resistance around N
            City. I
            would like to invite you to join our Resistance. I wonder if you have the intention?</p>

        <p>Hearing this.</p>

        <p>Li Yueming’s face revealed a look of interest.</p>

        <p>He was also the leader of the Resistance.</p>

        <p>Sun Ruo, that girl, was a miserable bastard. Right now, there were only a dozen or so members of the
            Resistance under
            her command.</p>

        <p>Then, look at Han Longfei.</p>

        <p>He stood out from the many selections of the Cloud Sky Group.</p>

        <p>As the leader of the Resistance, he took the position of the mayor of N City.</p>

        <p>As expected, one had to throw away goods when comparing them.</p>

        <p>In comparison, Sun Ruo, this girl, was simply too weak.</p>

        <p>He threw away his messy thoughts.</p>

        <p>Li Yueming touched his chin and said, “If I refuse, will a few strong men rush in and tie me up to silence
            me?”</p>

        <p>Han Longfei was stunned when he heard that. He obviously didn’t expect Li Yueming to answer like that.</p>

        <p>A moment later, he laughed out loud and said, “I, Han Longfei, will not be so forgiving. If you refuse, I can
            guarantee that the City Defense Army will not be an obstacle for you to escape from N City. However, there
            will be
            no other help. After all, there are people from the Cloud Sky Group’s headquarters everywhere near N City. I
            will
            not risk my life and my men’s lives to help an unrelated outsider!”</p>

        <p>Li Yueming felt a little bit of credibility.</p>

        <p>Of course.</p>

        <p>Joining the Resistance was one of the routes he had planned.</p>

        <p>Therefore, he did not waste any time and said directly, “So, what benefits do I get from joining you?”</p>

        <p>Han Longfei stopped smiling.</p>

        <p>If you’re willing to join us, I can take some risks to help you create evidence of an ‘accidental death’ he
            said with
            a solemn expression. I can also secretly arrange an escape truck for you. Our Resistance headquarters is
            hidden in
            the East Peak Mountain at the border between the Winter Moon Empire and the Red Maple Empire. You can go
            there and
            temporarily settle down and rest for a while to lay low!</p>

        <p>Li Yueming’s combat power and potential were extremely terrifying.</p>

        <p>The most important thing was that Li Yueming had an irreconcilable relationship with the corporate group.</p>

        <p>These two points combine together to form an</p>

        <p>Han Longfei naturally had to try to pull Li Yueming into the Resistance camp.</p>

        <p>For this, he was even willing to take a considerable risk.</p>

        <p>It could be said that the conditions he offered were quite sincere.</p>

        <p>After weighing the pros and cons.</p>

        <p>“I have another companion!” Li Yueming said.</p>

        <p>Hearing this.</p>

        <p>Han Longfei’s serious expression gradually eased. He smiled and said, “No problem. Welcome to the
            Resistance!”</p>

        <p>The two of them shook hands.</p>

        <p>Han Longfei took out an iron medal from his pocket and handed it to Li Yueming. “This is the token of our
            Resistance.
            Of course, it’s best if you don’t expose this thing in a city ruled by a tycoon. After all, our Resistance
            is hated
            by everyone no matter which city we are in…” Li Yueming took the medal.</p>

        <p>He rubbed it in his hand for a moment.</p>

        <p>This thing should be made of pure iron. There were spots of rust on it, and it looked rough and old.</p>

        <p>If one looked carefully, there were some blurry marks under the rust.</p>

        <p>However, it was a long time ago.</p>

        <p>Therefore, he couldn’t see the exact content on it.</p>

        <p>However, for some reason.</p>

        <p>Li Yueming felt an inexplicable sense of familiarity.</p>

        <p>Was it an illusion?</p>

        <p>Seeing that he was deep in thought.</p>

        <p>Han Longfei hesitated for a moment before saying, “Uh… I have two questions. Do you think it’s convenient to
            answer
            them?”</p>
