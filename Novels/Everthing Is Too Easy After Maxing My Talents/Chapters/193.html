        <p>Facing them, Li Yueming's expression softened a bit, and he smiled, "Everyone, you must be joking. Let's
            continue
            working!"</p>
        <p>He didn't seem to want to say more, and the men from the logistics department didn't press further. He
            returned to
            his post and continued working.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Li Yueming discovered a pile of broken parts and began picking them up. Observing this, a
            member
            of the logistics department discreetly reminded him, "Ministerâ€¦ Those parts were already scrapped and could
            only be
            reforged before they could be used again!"</p>
        <p>Li Yueming only smiled and offered no explanation. The logistics department thought he might have some mental
            issues,
            but he didn't say anything else and simply blinked.</p>
        <p>A month went by, and after Li Yueming had ousted Scarface from the logistics department, nobody came to
            inquire about
            him. Nonetheless, the news had still spread.</p>
        <p>In just one month, rumors about Li Yueming had circulated throughout the Resistance camp. Some claimed he was
            the
            leader's son, considering the critical task he was given right after arriving. Others believed he was a
            formidable
            supernatural being due to the incredible strength he'd displayed. With just one arm, he had strangled
            Scarface, a
            frequent forger, into submission. Of course, there were those who labeled him a lunatic since he hardly
            communicated
            with anyone in the base. Every day, he punched in and out of work on time and had a peculiar obsession with
            sifting
            through discarded parts in the logistics department.</p>
        <p>However, Li Yueming paid no attention to these rumors. He had been leading a fulfilling life during that
            month,
            thanks to his talent as a Wilderness Martial Saint. This ability allowed him to synchronize his attributes
            with his
            mecha and weapons. Possessing high-quality weapons and a powerful mech significantly increased his combat
            prowess.
        </p>
        <p>To escape successfully, he had to destroy his previous mech in N City's underground arena. Li Yueming even
            cut off
            some of his own flesh to fake his death. Despite his rapid recovery talent, he had broken into a cold sweat.
            Han
            Longfei had been the most frightened witness. He had seen Li Yueming cut off pieces of flesh without any
            emotion.
            Fresh blood oozed from the wound and then healed at an astonishing speed, new flesh forming in its place. It
            almost
            made Han Longfei regard Li Yueming as a mutant. Hence, upon reaching the Resistance base, Li Yueming's first
            choice
            was to join the logistics department, intending to construct a powerful combat mech for himself.</p>
        <p>At night, Li Yueming used his superbrain to deduce the necessary structures and materials for the mech.
            During the
            day, he searched for resources in the logistics department. He persisted and, after some trials and errors,
            finally
            achieved some progress. Within a week, he assembled the first-generation simplified version of the Warrior
            Sage
            Mech.</p>
        <p>In the third month, Li Yueming started upgrading the Warrior Sage mech with more defensive materials and a
            variety of
            weapons. However, Sun Ruo appeared before him.</p>
        <p>Li Yueming glanced at her but remained focused on his work. This young girl was a metal-type ability user,
            and in her
            eyes, all metal mechs were considered junk. Li Yueming had no way to change her perception except for
            beating her,
            which he had no intention of doing.</p>
        <p>Seeing his continued concentration on the mech, Sun Ruo pouted, showing her frustration. Nonetheless, she
            decided to
            ask, "When are you taking me out for some exercise? I'm almost suffocating from helping out in the child
            care
            department here!"</p>
        <p>Both Sun Ruo and Li Yueming concealed their true strength. They didn't reveal that they were supernatural
            beings, and
            Han Longfei hadn't disclosed their true combat capabilities to the base's higher-ups. Consequently, they
            were
            treated like regular people.</p>
        <p>Li Yueming was assigned to repair reproductive equipment in the back, while Sun Ruo was tasked with taking
            care of
            the children at the base's kindergarten. To be frank, it was quite surprising that Sun Ruo, with her lively
            personality, could endure two months in child care. Li Yueming couldn't help but find it unbelievable. She
            looked
            visibly bored.</p>
        <p>Li Yueming raised his head and replied, "At most, one month. I need to repair my mech first and then find an
            opportunity to practice."</p>
        <p>Upon hearing this, Sun Ruo seemed more energized. Observing the mech beneath Li Yueming, she asked, "Can you
            make one
            for me too? I'm a Metal Ability user, so I might have an advantage in operating a mech."</p>
        <p>Li Yueming glanced at her and nonchalantly said, "I'll make one for you when I have time."</p>
        <p>His expression remained unchanged. Sun Ruo then remarked, "No friends, no connections... Why do I feel like
            you're
            locking yourself in a cage?"</p>
        <p>Upon hearing this, Li Yueming paused in his work.</p>
