<p>Scarface, who had been frightened out of his wits, managed to cry out "Murder!" in desperation, but the panic in his voice made him sound more like an elderly woman than the burly figure he usually appeared to be.</p>
<p>Li Yueming observed Scarface and waved his hand to summon the abandoned sword back to his grip. With the blade held against Scarface's neck, he chided him for not following through on his threat to gather his supporters and instead bringing a child like MO Fei to the confrontation.</p>
<p>Scarface's cries ceased immediately as he trembled in fear and begged for his life. He even offered to testify that MO Fei had initiated the attack to clear his own name.</p>
<p>Li Yueming, however, had no need for Scarface's testimony. He knew what he had to do next. After extracting the information he needed from Scarface, Li Yueming swiftly executed him.</p>
<p>Leaving the logistics department, Li Yueming set his sights on the main supporters behind MO Fei. He decided to eliminate any potential future threats to his position in the Resistance camp.</p>
<p>As he inquired about MO Fei's key backers and continued to make swift strikes, Li Yueming's iron cleaver remained stained with blood.</p>
<p>He moved through the Resistance camp, leaving a trail of chaos in his wake. With his limited time, he didn't wish to become entangled in a predictable pattern of taking down one target after another, as he had more pressing matters to attend to.</p>
<p>With his knowledge of MO Fei's main supporters, Li Yueming aimed to ensure there would be no future interference from these individuals.</p>
<p>His next target was Deputy Leader Mika, a [B+] class supernatural being who had a longstanding dispute with Han Longfei. The two had differing views on the Resistance camp's size and its role in opposing the financial group.</p>
<p>Mika favored maintaining the current size to avoid attracting attention, allowing him to control the Resistance camp as his private army. In contrast, Han Longfei aimed to build the Rebellion Army into a significant force to challenge the financial group and restore planetary order.</p>
<p>Mika's objective was to gain control of the Resistance camp while Han Longfei was trapped in N City, and he believed he was close to achieving his goal. However, Li Yueming's actions and interference had disrupted this balance.</p>
<p>As Li Yueming arrived at Mika's location, the deputy leader realized that his life was in danger. He attempted to fend off Li Yueming, but the young warrior's skill and power proved overwhelming.</p>
<p>Li Yueming launched an attack against Mika with a sword that emitted a golden light, and Mika narrowly dodged the strike. However, he still sustained a significant gash on his chest, which bled profusely.</p>
