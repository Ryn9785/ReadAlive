        <br>
        <p>In the midst of a protracted war, Han Bufan had witnessed the tyranny of the corporations, as well as the desolation and isolation experienced by the common people. The more opulent a place seemed on the surface, the more corruption festered behind the scenes. It was under these circumstances that Han Bufan, in his twenties, decided to leave his job as a mercenary. After a series of clashes, he joined the Resistance. Before long, a stroke of luck landed him a position in N City's government office.</p>

<p>Over the course of two decades, he endured numerous hardships, eventually ascending to the role of City Lord of N City. He bore the responsibility for 90% of the Resistance's military expenses in the vicinity, along with access to countless resources. This positioned him as the leader of all nearby resistance forces, making Han Longfei a legendary figure in his native world. His accomplishments had earned the genuine admiration of Li Yueming.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, admiration was all it was. Li Yueming had long outgrown youthful fervor, and in this world, his primary concern was himself. Reflecting for a moment, Li Yueming replied seriously, "What makes you believe that the Chaos Clan will collaborate with you?"</p>

<p>"You're not content with mediocrity, are you?" Han Longfei asked earnestly. He believed that a true man must leave a legacy for future generations. Han Longfei himself acknowledged his limited talents, destined to be an ordinary person. However, he saw exceptional potential in Li Yueming, someone who needed only a little refinement to become the sharpest sword in the world.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't the sharpest sword be aimed at the most formidable and ruthless foe?"</p>

<p>"I don't desire power or wealth," Han Longfei continued. "I'm even willing to relinquish my position as the Resistance camp leader and work behind the scenes, providing you with information, resources, and technology. Our shared objective is to overthrow corporate rule and restore the world to its rightful state. When that day comes, all those oppressed by the corporations will remember your achievements."</p>

<p>As Han Longfei's passionate speech came to an end, he was visibly stirred. He had worked tirelessly for two decades and was now approaching the age of forty, with his zeal gradually waning. Li Yueming's sudden appearance rekindled hope within him.</p>

<p>However, Li Yueming had to be pragmatic. He responded, "What you're saying is idealistic and noble, but it doesn't seem to concern me."</p>

<p>On the other end of the line, Han Longfei struggled to respond to Li Yueming's clear rejection. He remained silent for a considerable period.</p>

<p>After contemplating the situation, Li Yueming continued, "To be remembered and appreciated by all of humanity... I don't need that. I lack morality, and I don't have any scruples. However, I have no objections to working with you until conflicts arise."</p>

<p>Hearing this, Han Longfei was momentarily stunned. When he regained his composure, he realized that he had become overly impassioned.</p>

<p>With an awkward tone, he said, "You're right. I allowed my emotions to get the better of me. Let's hope our cooperation endures."</p>

<p>Li Yueming remained silent. According to his self-set trajectory, his relationship with the corporations would likely lead to a showdown. But that was his business, and he didn't want anyone influencing his decisions. Therefore, he refrained from making any promises to Han Longfei.</p>

<p>Half a month later, all six battalions of the Rebellion Army assembled in the camp's central square. As he looked down at the numerous Resistance soldiers, Li Yueming skipped pleasantries and stated, "There is only one order I need to announce that brought you here."</p>

<p>"The original six battalions will be disbanded, and all soldiers will be reorganized into a new army composed of five types: Combat troops, logistics troops, transport troops, long-range attack troops. Each unit will have different responsibilities and missions. Specific details will be sent to everyone shortly."</p>

<p>"Additionally, the experienced captains are assigned as tactical instructors for the new units, responsible for teaching and training the recruits."</p>

<p>Li Yueming's words were brief, but every directive contained a significant shift that would rock the entire rebel camp. Disbanding the six major forces was not a minor decision, and the captains of these forces held significant power. This move challenged their status.</p>

<p>The moment the order was given, the ordinary soldiers in the Resistance camp were in uproar. They eagerly looked at their respective brigade captains, expecting them to oppose this order and collectively protest. They wanted to demonstrate their collective strength to the new and seemingly inexperienced leader.</p>

<p>Could the six captains endure this decision without losing their dignity and security?</p>

<p>The answer was unexpected. Instead of rising to the challenge, the six captains stood there like statues, not showing any resistance. They even displayed polite, if awkward, smiles when Li Yueming's gaze fell on them.</p>

<p>This bizarre scene left the thousands of soldiers dumbfounded. When did these powerful captains become so docile? They had been stripped of their positions without resistance.</p>

<p>The infuriated soldiers gazed at their captains, expecting them to put up a fight, but the captains remained still, their faces displaying a mix of nervousness and forced smiles.</p>
