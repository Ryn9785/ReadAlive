        <br>
        <p>A moment later, he smiled and remarked, "I'm destined to be a tourist. I just want to enjoy the scenery along the way. If I become too obsessed, I'll end up empty-handed!"</p>
<p>Sun Ruo's face displayed a hint of doubt, clearly unable to comprehend Li Mingming's perspective. Yet, at this moment, Li Yueming's sense of alienation was like an abyss, separating him from the world. He couldn't understand why, and that uncertainty weighed heavily on him. It seemed that since the moment he met Li Yueming, he had been out of place in this world.</p>
<p>Sun Ruo's eyes glistened with a thin layer of mist, but she chose not to say anything. She turned and walked out of the logistics department.</p>
<p>However, when she reached the door, Sun Ruo suddenly stopped and said, "That MO Fei is so annoying. Lately, he's been coming to my place every day to curry favor. If nobody takes action, I'll have to handle it myself."</p>
<p>Behind her, Li Yueming continued cleaning his mecha, showing no reaction.</p>
<p>After Sun Ruo departed, Li Yueming let out a soft sigh. It was all because he was too handsome; his undeniable charm seemed to attract young girls like a magnet. However, in his past life, he had experienced the pain of love that was akin to a moth drawn to a flame. A woman named Ye Nanyuan had thrown herself recklessly into danger without regard for her own safety. In the end, it only brought loneliness, solitude, and immense regret. Such heart-wrenching pain, engraved deeply in his heart after experiencing it once, made love feel like a sharp blade. Each cut inflicted a real wound, and he had no desire to experience it again in this life. If he had to, he'd wait until he was confident enough to lead his partner through countless worlds.</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, another month passed. During this time, aside from designing and building his mecha, Li Yueming had ventured out once, but the details remained undisclosed. Afterward, he heard that MO Fei's Third Brigade had gone hunting in the mountains. That's when he returned to the logistics department to continue his work.</p>
<p>By the end of the month, Li Yueming had completed his second-generation Warrior Sage mecha. Moreover, he had just turned seven.</p>
<p>[You have successfully altered your fate. At the age of seven, you have temporarily evaded the Cloud Sky Group's pursuit and joined the largest resistance force in the Red Leaf Empire!]</p>
<p>[Your reincarnation score has significantly increased!]</p>
<p>[Additional reward of 20,000 reincarnation points!]</p>
<p>The main body of the Martial Saint Warrior was constructed from a Level 3 military-grade material, while the other components were hand-picked, polished, and repaired by Li Yueming. After a week of testing, this mech displayed twice the performance of the one he had used in the underground arena, largely due to the ample time for optimization. Its appearance was also more eye-catching, with the silver-gray metal offering a unique aesthetic. The only thing lacking was a suitable weapon.</p>
<p>However, Li Yueming was undeterred. He had heard of an exceedingly rare meteorite in the East Peak Mountain, a meteorite alloy that had fallen from the three massive moons orbiting planet 3-15741. This alloy possessed exceptional malleability and hardness. With a few of these meteorites, he should be able to craft the weapon he desired.</p>
<p>Li Yueming searched the entire logistics arsenal of the survivor base, but he couldn't find any alloy suitable for creating weapons. The available materials were either too brittle or not strong enough to serve his purpose. The weapons he forged didn't provide the desired bonus.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Li Yueming remained unfazed. He had heard rumors about the existence of such meteorites in the East Peak Mountain.</p>
<p>Just as Li Yueming admired his creation, the bustling noises in the logistics department came to a sudden halt. Li Yueming turned around to find MO Fei and his scar-faced uncle scrutinizing him.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Li Yueming smiled and asked, "Is it the right time to make your move? How can I assist you two?"</p>
<p>MO Fei, a newly promoted supernatural being in the Resistance camp, was only twenty-two years old but had already achieved a C+ level in supernatural abilities. He was a rising star, and it was rumored that the deputy leader and several captains wanted him to form a new brigade. However, the leader's approval was still pending.</p>
<p>He hadn't expected this development, which was why he resented Li Yueming. MO Fei was young and proud, believing he was the pride of the world. He couldn't be bothered with someone even younger than himself like Li Yueming. MO Fei surveyed Li Yueming from head to toe, his expression cold, and asked, "You're a Growth-user, right?"</p>
<p>Li Yueming glanced at his mecha and the various mechanical parts he was working with. It was no wonder he was mistaken for a transmigrator. Operating such equipment with expertise was typically a skill associated with transmigrators. Li Yueming couldn't help but chuckle and replied, "I'm in a good mood today. I don't feel like causing a public disturbance. I hope you understand your place. If you have something to say, say it quickly."</p>
<p>MO Fei's expression turned colder, but he quickly restrained his temper, remembering his purpose for being there. He retorted, "I've already shown you enough leniency by not confronting you for bullying my uncle. I hope you won't be so shameless."</p>
<p>With that, he thought of the message he had just received and a triumphant smile crept onto his face. He looked at Li Yueming and added, "Regarding the captaincy, the leader has given his approval for me to take charge of the newly established Seventh Brigade. As for you, the leader suggested that you can find a seat anytime. Do you understand what that means?"</p>
<p>Li Yueming needed a moment to comprehend the leader's intentions, realizing that Han Longfei was a cunning strategist. However, Li Yueming was not opposed to it. He had wanted to eliminate MO Fei even before Han Longfei's hint. Without any nudging from the leader, he would have found an opportunity to take out MO Fei.</p>
<p>As he assessed MO Fei, Li Yueming wondered about the young man's intelligence. He nodded and said, "I understand the leader's intentions."</p>
<p>MO Fei believed that Li Yueming had grasped his hint, so he continued with satisfaction, "Since you're so cooperative, I'll arrange a minor captain position for you. Starting next week, you'll accompany me to the training grounds for recruiting new members."</p>
<p>With that, MO Fei put on a leader's air and prepared to depart. But at that moment, he noticed the complex look in Li Yueming's eyes, a gaze that seemed to view him as a peculiar and foolish individual.</p>
<p>Baffled, MO Fei followed Li Yueming's gaze and realized that Li Yueming was observing him. He briefly pondered what Li Yueming was up to, but before he could ask, Li Yueming grabbed an abandoned sword from the ground. MO Fei's face contorted in disbelief, and then a burst of golden light erupted, slashing down.</p>
