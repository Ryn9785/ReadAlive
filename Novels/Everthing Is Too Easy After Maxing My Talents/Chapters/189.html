        <br>
        <p>The smoke billowed in the desert, and the sun hung round over the long river. A military pickup truck rumbled
            along a
            desolate and deteriorating intercity road, alone on its journey.</p>

        <p>This road had been constructed during the government's rule over 300 years ago, once a wide and unobstructed
            main
            artery of the city. However, now, it was a narrow, one-way path, eroded by both the relentless passage of
            time and
            the encroaching sands of the desert.</p>

        <p>This was Wenglado, the desert city of the Red Leaf Empire. According to historical records, more than three
            centuries
            ago, it stood as one of the most vital industrial cities in the north of the Red Leaf Empire.</p>

        <p>However, during a power struggle, it had become the primary battleground between government forces and
            powerful
            corporations. The conflict had reached its zenith, with both sides detonating numerous large nuclear bombs
            in this
            region.</p>

        <p>Now, all that remained were a few withered plants on the roadside and occasional glimpses of abandoned
            skyscrapers
            buried in the desert's embrace.</p>

        <p>The wheels of the truck spun through the air, raising yellow sand and intensifying the sense of desolation.
        </p>

        <p>Inside the vehicle, two resistance soldiers dressed as mercenaries glanced at the truck's rearview mirror to
            ensure
            there were no pursuers or other vehicles behind them.</p>

        <p>The driver, with a hint of relief, said, "We're safe here. You can come out and get some fresh air."</p>

        <p>Upon hearing this, Sun Ruo unwrapped the special nano-material covering around her and, with a red face,
            stuck her
            head out for a breath of fresh air. "It's like three layers inside and three layers outside; I was almost
            suffocating!"</p>

        <p>The resistance soldier driving chuckled and commented, "This precaution is for your safety. Without
            disguising you so
            thoroughly, it would be impossible to evade the security of the Yunxiao Corporation."</p>

        <p>In the container behind the truck, Li Yueming also poked his head out. When Sun Ruo met his gaze, she
            couldn't help
            but recall their intimate contact just moments ago, and her face reddened. After a brief moment of
            awkwardness with Li
            Yueming, she broke the silence, asking impatiently, "What special talent have you awakened? Let's see if
            it's
            among the
            first-rank talents."</p>

        <p>Li Yueming glanced at her and replied casually, "Martial Saint of the Wilderness. Do you understand?"</p>

        <p>Upon hearing this, Sun Ruo couldn't hide her confusion and asked, "You've never heard of it, have you? Well,
            given
            your limited horizons, that's not surprising."</p>

        <p>Sun Ruo felt slighted, and to downplay her confusion, she added, "I haven't heard of a talent like Martial
            Saint of
            the Wilderness, but I've heard of ancient martial art practitioners. Maybe your talent is related to them."
        </p>

        <p>Li Yueming's expression shifted when he heard the phrase "ancient martial arts practitioners." He asked with
            keen
            interest, "Ancient martial arts practitioners? Tell me more."</p>

        <p>Sun Ruo turned red again and stammered, "I heard my father mention it when I was young. I don't know the
            details."
        </p>

        <p>Li Yueming rolled his eyes, signaling that it was a sensitive topic, considering Sun Ruo's parents had passed
            away.
            He chose to disregard her and turned his attention to the desert scenery outside the pickup.</p>

        <p>In the front seats, the two rebel mercenaries, Takagi and Takata, were responsible for transporting supplies
            between
            East Peak Mountain and N City, all while maintaining their secret identities. They discussed the journey
            ahead,
            explaining that they had taken a remote, uncontrolled road to avoid detection. If all went well, they
            expected to
            reach their destination in ten days. However, they might encounter trouble, such as being targeted by
            scavengers in
            nearby rogue gathering areas.</p>

        <p>As the truck continued on its path through the desolation, the trio contemplated the challenges that lay
            ahead in
            their escape from the grasp of the Yunxiao Corporation.</p>
