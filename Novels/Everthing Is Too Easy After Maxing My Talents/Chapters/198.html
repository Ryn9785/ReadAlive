        <br>
        <p>"Who agrees with this proposal? Who disagrees?" Li Yueming's indifferent voice resonated.</p>

<p>The upper echelons of the Resistance glanced at each other, and an oppressive silence descended upon the room. After a moment, the higher-ups who had regained their composure exchanged unsure glances.</p>

<p>No one dared to take the lead in this situation. The young man sitting before them displayed an astonishing level of confidence. It was clear that he possessed a trump card they were unaware of. Moreover, the recent events, including the deaths of MO Fei and Han Longyan, had underscored the gravity of the situation. Underestimating Li Yueming was no longer an option.</p>

<p>Seeing that nobody dared to speak, Li Yueming, who occupied the main seat, cleared his throat. He then, knocking on the table, spoke, "As you all know, I've always been a reasonable person. If you wish to be reasonable, I will allow it. If you don't, I can assist you. So, if any of you have differing opinions, please feel free to voice them. I assure you, I'm not a monster, and I won't harm you."</p>

<p>The higher-ups exchanged uncertain glances as they observed Li Yueming's smiling demeanor. They were perplexed, but no one dared to step forward.</p>

<p>After a prolonged silence, the captain of the 4th Battalion finally mustered the courage to speak. "In that case, what about Vice-Chief Mika? We should have him present before we proceed with the vote."</p>

<p>This captain was one of Mika's trusted allies, and although he felt uneasy about the situation, he was willing to step forward to gather more information.</p>

<p>Upon hearing this suggestion, Li Yueming smiled and remarked, "That's a reasonable request. Vice-Chief Mika should have a say in this matter." He clapped his hands, and in the room behind them, Sun Ruo carried Mika's badly wounded body, now resembling a porcupine, to the table, tossing him onto it with a resentful expression.</p>

<p>Mika was covered in blood, and the room fell silent. Li Yueming observed the scene and stated with a smile, "Vice-Chief Mika and I had a difference of opinion, so we had a friendly discussion, and it seems I came out on top."</p>

<p>The Resistance's upper echelons were left speechless. After all, Mika's strength had been unparalleled in the entire Resistance camp. The sight of his battered state was both shocking and unsettling.</p>

<p>What was more absurd was Li Yueming's claim of a 'friendly discussion.' This left them wondering what an 'unfriendly agreement' might entail. They recalled Li Yueming's earlier statement to express their views, which made them swallow nervously. Had they spoken out, would they have been in Mika's position?</p>

<p>Amid these reflections, the captain of the 4th Battalion felt the mounting pressure. He looked at Li Yueming, who wore a half-smile. Sweating profusely, he felt a growing unease.</p>

<p>He had believed that Li Yueming had only subdued Mika, prompting him to ask for Mika's release. However, he had not expected Li Yueming to be so ruthless as to kill Mika. This realization left him embarrassed and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>As the captain of the 4th Battalion, who was one of Mika's core supporters, he couldn't help but feel a sense of shame and regret. To save face, he forced a smile and resumed his seat, saying, "I understand now. I have no more doubts. On behalf of the 4th Battalion, I wholeheartedly support your appointment as the new deputy leader of the Resistance in N City."</p>

<p>His voice had been a bit too loud earlier, but he was now trying to make amends. He had no intention of challenging Li Yueming, as the young man's strength was evidently overwhelming. Even Mika had been unable to defeat him. He realized it was wiser to accept the situation.</p>

<p>This hasty calculation, however, did not sit well with the other captains, who regarded it as a display of subservience. They exchanged mocking glances, and the captain of the 4th Battalion felt the weight of their judgment. Nonetheless, he carried on, attempting to save face and hoping for preferential treatment from the new Deputy Chief for being the first to acknowledge his defeat.</p>

<p>Sitting at the head of the table, Li Yueming displayed a satisfied smile.</p>
