        <div class="chapter-number">Chapter 199: Hope and Disappointment, The Decent Li Yueming_2</div>
        <br>
        <p>Li Yueming approached the captain of the 4th Brigade, patting him on the shoulder. "That's right, you and I are both decent people."</p>

<p>As he finished speaking, he gazed at the other captains and inquired once more, "Is there anyone who disagrees?"</p>

<p>Among the remaining three captains, the captain of the second brigade, with thick eyebrows and big eyes, stood up first, his voice unwavering as he stated, "I object."</p>

<p>The words "I object" seemed to carry a certain magical weight, causing the other captains, who had been poised to express their views, to freeze in their seats. They braced themselves for what they anticipated would be an intriguing showdown.</p>

<p>However, to their surprise, the captain of the second brigade didn't offer a compelling argument or reason for his objection. Instead, he solemnly continued, "I object. With your strength, you should be the leader."</p>

<p>This unexpected response left the other company leaders bewildered. They couldn't believe that the captain with thick eyebrows and big eyes had voiced his objection only to yield and express support for Li Yueming's leadership.</p>

<p>The other captains, who had been poised for a heated debate, were taken aback. The captain of the second brigade, who usually came across as rather simple-minded, had displayed unwavering determination when it mattered most.</p>

<p>In reality, they had all realized that Li Yueming's strength and the force behind him were far beyond their ability to contest. Mika's fate had served as a stark reminder of this fact.</p>

<p>Consequently, they had opted to go with the flow rather than resist, just as the captain of the 4th Battalion had done, albeit not in the most graceful manner.</p>

<p>This situation had caught Li Yueming off guard, as he hadn't anticipated such swift capitulation. He had expected to employ further methods of coercion and persuasion, but the moment Mika's body was tossed onto the table, the Resistance's upper echelons had yielded to the prevailing winds.</p>

<p>Their attempts to impress Li Yueming and win his favor had backfired, leading to absurd suggestions that Li Yueming should become the new leader of the Resistance. It was all much smoother than Li Yueming had envisioned.</p>

<p>Of course, Li Yueming wasn't seeking to become the actual leader at this point. In the eyes of the Resistance camp's soldiers and residents, he was still a trusted subordinate sent by Han Longfei. Replacing Han Longfei at this juncture would only cause unnecessary chaos.</p>

<p>Moreover, having Han Longfei as the leader provided a convenient scapegoat for Li Yueming to utilize when needed. He had no intention of relinquishing that potential advantage.</p>

<p>With the situation settled, Li Yueming had effectively taken control of the Resistance camp. He officially became the new Deputy Chief of the Resistance Base in N City, as announced in the appointment document that he had drafted in Han Longfei's name.</p>

<p>As for Han Longfei, he was now relegated to the role of a decorative figurehead, no longer holding real authority.</p>

<p>At 2 o'clock in the afternoon, Han Longfei called Li Yueming and chided him, "You're quite audacious..."</p>

<p>Clearly, he was aware of the events unfolding in the base. Li Yueming had killed Mika and seized the position of Deputy Chief, essentially attempting to take over leadership.</p>

<p>Having successfully assumed control, Li Yueming had effectively pushed Han Longfei, the previous leader, to the side as a mere ornament.</p>

<p>Li Yueming didn't mince his words, exposing Han Longfei's manipulations. "Hehe, do you think I'm unaware of your schemes? Now that I'm the Deputy Chief, doesn't it feel just as satisfying for you?"</p>

<p>On the other end of the line, Han Longfei fell silent for a moment before he chuckled. "You're right."</p>

<p>He laughed, and then his tone grew serious. "My goal is to overthrow the corporations and return the world to the people and the government."</p>

<p>Li Yueming offered his praise, "That's a commendable and lofty ideal."</p>

<p>Han Longfei, however, wasn't seeking validation. He continued, "Before I met you, I was deeply disillusioned with this world. I felt that no one could rescue it from the abyss. But after encountering you, I knew that the one who could bring about change had finally arrived."</p>

<p>This revelation left Li Yueming momentarily surprised, though he soon replied calmly, "Thank you for your kind words, but I'm not sure I can live up to your expectations."</p>

<p>"My intuition tells me that you are unique and unlike anyone else," Han Longfei asserted.</p>

<p>Li Yueming fell silent for a moment. Despite the geographical distance between them, he could understand Han Longfei's sense of isolation and loneliness. In a world steeped in excess and debauchery, a clear-headed individual often grappled with a profound sense of solitude.</p>

<p>According to the information he had gathered, Han Longfei had been an international mercenary two decades ago, constantly traversing battlefields. The memory of those tumultuous times must have left a deep mark on his psyche.</p>

<p>Han Longfei had believed that Li Yueming possessed the potential to bring about change in a world that had lost its moral compass. He had been searching for someone like Li Yueming for over a decade, and now he saw that potential fulfilled.</p>
