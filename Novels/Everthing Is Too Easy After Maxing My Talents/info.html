        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Everyone found themselves transported to a simulated world where every young individual would have the
            opportunity to
            experience a new life upon reaching adulthood. Those who could surpass their limitations would permanently
            become
            "regressors" with mastery over every aspect of existence. However, those who failed would be relegated to
            the status
            of ordinary individuals, reliant on others for protection. Many exercised extreme caution within the
            simulation to
            avoid making any mistakes. However, when Li Yueming entered the simulated world of regressors, he discovered
            that
            his randomly assigned talent was a 100x Amplification.</p>

        <p>Your Blue-rank talent, "Sudden Knowledge," has evolved through the
            100x
            Amplification to
            become the Gold-rank talent, "Unlimited Deduction."</p>
        <p><span><em>Unlimited Deduction (Gold): Deduce known information with a 100% success rate.</em></span></p>

        <p>As he continued to acquire the highest-ranked talents, he suddenly realized that the simulated world, once
            referred
            to as hell, wasn't as formidable as it seemed. "I suppose the next one will be a piece of cake too."</p>
